        <p><b>GRADUATING:</b> 2024</p>

        <p><b>STORY/ITEM:</b> My family's house used to be at the top of a hill. I would frequently bomb-it down this hill on my
        RipStick, without any protective equipment... On time I decided to go down the hill right after a hurricane had
        passed through. Everything was fine until I approached the bottom, and my front wheel hit into a thick
        tree-branch that had fallen down. I got launched forward, landed on my knees, and then shredded my knees bloody
        until I finally lost momentum.</p>
